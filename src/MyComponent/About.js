        This ToDo application is a simple yet effective tool for managing tasks.
        It allows users to add, view, and delete tasks, ensuring they stay organized
        and on top of their responsibilities. The app uses React for the front-end 
        and leverages localStorage to persist data, so tasks remain available even
         after the page is refreshed.
